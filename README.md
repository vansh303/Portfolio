This is a dummy portfolio website created to practice building a personal site and to showcase basic web development skills. It includes common sections such as an "About Me" section, a list of skills, a few sample projects, and contact information. The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on both desktop and mobile devices.

The site is built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. You can open the index.html file in any browser to view the site locally. If you're using a code editor like VS Code, you can also use a live server extension to preview your changes in real-time.

This project is meant for learning purposes only. It doesn’t include real personal data, and the contact form (if included) is non-functional or uses a placeholder service.

Feel free to use this template and customize it with your own content, styles, or extra features. It’s a great way to get started with creating your own online portfolio.
